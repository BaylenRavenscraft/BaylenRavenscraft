- 👋 Hi, I’m @BaylenRavenscraft
- 👀 I’m interested in animals, art, aliens, and anti-capitalist revolution! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning neuroscience and mitochondriology. Also Python, Mandarin, and Russian.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing programs to communicate with animals, programs to aid in complex origami pattern designs, and a proof-of-concept program for enhanced logistical distrubtion networks which would operate sans a monetary system.
