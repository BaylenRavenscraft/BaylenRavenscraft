- 👋 Hi, I’m @BaylenRavenscraft
- 👀 I’m interested in animals, art, and anti-capitalist revolution! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning neuroscience and mitochondriology. Also Python, Mandarin, and Russian.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing programs to communicate with animals, programs to aid in complex origami pattern designs, and a proof-of-concept program for enhanced logistical distrubtion networks which would operate sans a monetary system.
- 📫 How to reach me: shine the batsymbol into the early morning sky, but add more another set of wings at both shoulders and one wing behind the head, and two little wings and each foot...
