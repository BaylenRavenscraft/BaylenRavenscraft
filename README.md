- 👋 Hi, I’m @BaylenRavenscraft
- 👀 I’m interested in animals, art, aliens, and anti-capitalist revolution! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning neuroscience and mitochondriology. Also Python, Mandarin, and Russian.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything! Some current ideas: {a program to quickly identify flying objects on a closed circuit vdeo system} {a program to control a high-powered LED laser to shine at a moving UFO} {a program to analyze the cat meowing sounds of video files to isolate repeated patterns, then to fetch the video immediately preceding, during and after those patterned meows; then to optimize that program to work on anyone's cats with only serveral recordings} {a model of a non-monetary-based logistical netowrk program, which could operate with real-time demands and adaptations} {a program that uses image analysis and categorized language characters to fetch and translate written laguage via an app} {an inproved ominous beeping app that can be activated for beeping by pressing external buttons 5 times very quickly} {a program that predicts the influences of climate change, with resolution to specific towns/cities, and linking engagement opportunities against the biggest polluters specific to that regions; additionally, the prediction can be adjusted between 1.5 and 8 degress C of warming}
